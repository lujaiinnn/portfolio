    <h2>The Project Challenge</h2>
    <p>Working with a multinational brand, I was tasked to make sense of fragmented sales data: regional revenue, seasonal performance, and customer segmentation. Static spreadsheets were overwhelming. My job was to transform this chaos into clarity using Power BI and Tableau.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goal 1:</strong> Compare performance across regions</li>
      <li><strong>Goal 2:</strong> Identify monthly sales trends</li>
      <li><strong>Goal 3:</strong> Spot hidden customer segments</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Building the Dashboards</h2>
    <h3>Power BI: The Dynamic Analyzer</h3>
    <p>I used Power BI to create a dashboard with slicers, KPI cards, and time-series graphs. It allowed users to filter data by year, region, or category in real-time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> DAX measures, slicers, clustered bar charts</li>
      <li><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Region C underperformed in Q2. Marketing realigned campaigns accordingly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tableau: The Storyteller</h3>
    <p>With Tableau, I crafted a dashboard focused on visual storytelling. Heatmaps and geographic maps highlighted trends that weren't visible in tables.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Filters, heatmaps, maps, dashboard actions</li>
      <li><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Smaller towns in semi-urban areas drove surprise revenue spikes.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Conclusion & Reflection</h2>
    <p>While Power BI excelled at exploration and real-time filtering, Tableau empowered me to highlight the narrative behind the numbers. Both tools brought different strengths—but together, they told a complete story.</p>
    <p>From this project, decision-makers gained clarity on underperforming regions, hidden market opportunities, and seasonal sales patterns—all because of thoughtful dashboard design.</p>
    <h3>Final Takeaway</h3>
    <p>Data analysis doesn’t end with numbers—it starts there. Visualization is the bridge that connects numbers to actions. With Power BI and Tableau, I learned how to be both an analyst and a storyteller.</p>
