    <h1>From Chaos to Clarity</h1>
    <h4 class="text-muted">How Data Analysis Uncovered Hidden Patterns</h4>
    <p class="mt-4">When a logistics company approached me with a problem of rising delays and delivery costs, I knew that the answer was hidden inside their own data. This blog walks you through how structured analysis turned messy data into meaningful actions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 1: Understand the Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset included shipment ID, pickup and delivery dates, weight, distance, transport type, and status. At first glance, it was messy and filled with inconsistencies—missing values, outliers, and unclear formatting.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify why deliveries were delayed</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary goal:</strong> Reduce cost without compromising speed</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 2: Clean, Visualize & Analyze</h2>
    <h3>Cleaning the Data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Handled missing delivery dates using imputation</li>
      <li>Removed duplicates and outliers in weight and duration</li>
      <li>Created a new column for delay time</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h3>
    <p>Using Python (Pandas + Seaborn), I created:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bar plots comparing delay by transport type</li>
      <li>Heatmaps for correlation between delay and weight</li>
      <li>Boxplots showing regional delivery inconsistencies</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Air transport had higher delay frequency despite being the fastest. Road was slower but more consistent.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 3: Recommendations & Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use road transport for all short-distance shipments</li>
      <li>Limit air use to lightweight, urgent packages only</li>
      <li>Implement vendor alert system for repeated late deliveries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Outcome</h3>
    <p>After applying these insights, the company reported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>15% cost reduction</strong> within 2 months</li>
      <li><strong>20% improvement</strong> in on-time delivery rate</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>This project showed me the true power of structured thinking. Data analysis is not just about finding trends—it's about turning them into actions. And when done right, it creates measurable change.</p>
